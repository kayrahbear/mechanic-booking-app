## Environment Variables Required

Add these environment variables to your deployment:

```bash
# SMTP2GO Configuration
SMTP2GO_USERNAME=your_smtp2go_username
SMTP2GO_PASSWORD=your_smtp2go_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@monkeyboigarage.com

# Service Area Configuration
SERVICE_AREA_ZIPS=12345,67890,54321  # Comma-separated list of serviceable ZIP codes

# Optional Configuration
BOOKING_URL=https://monkeyboigarage.com/book  # For rebooking links in denial emails
```

## SMTP2GO Setup Steps

1. **Sign up** at [smtp2go.com](https://smtp2go.com) (free account)
2. **Verify your domain** or use their subdomain for testing
3. **Get SMTP credentials** from the dashboard:
   - Username: Usually your email or account name
   - Password: Generated SMTP password (not your login password)
4. **Configure environment variables** in your Cloud Run services

## Email Flow

### 1. Booking Submission
- Customer submits booking form with address
- Service area validation occurs
- Confirmation email sent immediately
- Booking status: `PENDING`

### 2. Booking Approval
- Mechanic/admin approves booking
- Approval email sent with:
  - Mechanic phone number
  - Google Calendar "Add to Calendar" link
  - Service location details
- Booking status: `CONFIRMED`

### 3. Booking Denial
- Mechanic/admin denies booking
- Denial email sent with:
  - Reason for denial (if provided)
  - Link to book another time
  - Alternative scheduling suggestions
- Booking status: `DENIED`

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Set environment variables in your local environment
2. Start the worker service: `cd backend/worker && python main.py`
3. Create a test booking through the frontend
4. Check worker logs for email sending status

### Production Testing
1. Deploy with environment variables configured
2. Create a test booking with a real email address
3. Verify emails are received and formatted correctly
4. Test Google Calendar link functionality

## Service Area Configuration

The service area is configured via the `SERVICE_AREA_ZIPS` environment variable:

```bash
# Example: Service area covering multiple ZIP codes
SERVICE_AREA_ZIPS="37013, 37014, 37016, 37020, 37027, 37031, 37034, 37037, 37046, 37060, 37064, 37066, 37067, 37069, 37072, 37075, 37076, 37080, 37085, 37087, 37090, 37115, 37118, 37122, 37127, 37128, 37129, 37130, 37132, 37135, 37138, 37143, 37149, 37153, 37167, 37174, 37179, 37180, 37184, 37189, 37201, 37203, 37204, 37205, 37206, 37207, 37208, 37209, 37210, 37211, 37212, 37213, 37214, 37215, 37216, 37217, 37218, 37219, 37220, 37221, 37228, 37232, 37238"

# For development (allows all ZIP codes):
# Leave SERVICE_AREA_ZIPS empty or unset
```

## Monitoring

- Email sending status is logged in Cloud Run worker logs
- Failed emails trigger Cloud Tasks retries (up to 5 attempts)
- Monitor SMTP2GO dashboard for delivery statistics

## Cost Considerations

- **SMTP2GO Free Tier**: 1,000 emails/month
- **Estimated Usage**: ~3 emails per booking (confirmation + approval/denial)
- **Capacity**: ~330 bookings/month on free tier
- **Upgrade Path**: SMTP2GO paid plans available for higher volume

## Next Steps

1. **Add Mechanic Phone**: Manually add phone number to existing mechanic record in Firestore
2. **Configure Service Area**: Set `SERVICE_AREA_ZIPS` environment variable
3. **Set Up SMTP2GO**: Create account and configure credentials
4. **Deploy**: Update Cloud Run services with new environment variables
5. **Test**: Create test bookings to verify email delivery

## Security Notes

- SMTP credentials are stored as environment variables (consider using Secret Manager)
- Email templates are server-side rendered (no client-side exposure)
- Service area validation prevents bookings outside coverage area
- All email sending is asynchronous via Cloud Tasks for reliability
